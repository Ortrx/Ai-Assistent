# Ai Assistent
This is a simple Ai Assistent, wich you can add to your website. It works with ChatGPT Api and uses the "text-davinci-003" model.



## Installation

1. Download the code with this command:

```bash
  git clone https://github.com/Ortrx/Ai-Assistent.git
``` 
or simply donwload the .zip file.

2. Replace YOUR_API_KEY in line 237,

```bash 
const CHATGPT_API_KEY = 'YOUR_API_KEY';
```
with your Open Ai Api Key. I'm poor sorry :( 
If you don't have one you can get it here: https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys .
    
## Demo

I also hosted the site here: https://ai-assistent.netlify.app/ (but it won't work because it has no valid api key in it but you'll see how it looks like)
